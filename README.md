<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims at enabling the classical P-graph Framework (www.p-graph.org) to interface with modern Python programming ecosystems. The backend solver is the original executable from P-graph, staying true to the original implementation of P-graph. For manual network manipulation, the P-graph studio can be downloaded from this link: https://p-graph.org/downloads/.
